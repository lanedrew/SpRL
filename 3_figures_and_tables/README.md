# Figures and Tables
The numbered scripts in this folder can be run to recreate the figures and tables appearing in the paper (excluding Table 1, Table 2, and Figure 2). Scripts should be run in increasing numerical order and the order of generation reflects the order of appearance in the paper (including figures and tables in the supplementary materials).

## Script Descriptions
We provide descriptions of each script in the sequence below.

1. 1_generate_empirical_data_raster_plots.R: 

    This script generates Figure 1 from the paper.
  
2. 2_generate_timing_results_plots.R: 

    This script generates Figures 3 and 4 from the paper.
  
3. 3_generate_empirical_coverage_comparison_plot.R: 

    This script generates Figure 5 from the paper.
  
4. 4_generate_predicted_growth_curve_plot.R: 

    This script generates Figure 6 from the paper.
  
5. 5_generate_data_realization_plot.R: 

    This script generates Figure 7 from the paper.
  
6. 6_generate_simulated_linkage_performance_comparison_plot.R: 

    This script generates Figure 8 from the paper. By modifying the specified $\alpha$ level (2 or 3) and $N$ threshold (10 or 25), this script can also be used to generate Plots 3-7 from the supplement.

7. 7_generate_simulated_growth_performance_table.R: 

    This script generates Table 3 from the paper. By modifying the specified $\alpha$ level (2 or 3) and $N$ threshold (10 or 25), this script can also be used to generate Tables 3-7 from the supplement.
  
8. 8_generate_empirical_linkage_convergence_metrics.R

    This script generates Figure 1 from the supplement.

9. 9_generate_sCRPS_tables.R

    This script generates Tables 1 and 2 from the supplement.

10. 10_generate_replicated_density_comparison_plot.R

    This script generates Figure 2 from the supplement.
