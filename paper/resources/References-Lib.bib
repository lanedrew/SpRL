We then introduce the three types of underlying models for probabilistic record linkage: Fellegi-Sunter-based methods, machine learning methods, and Bayesian methods. Practical considerations, such as data standardization and privacy concerns, are then discussed. Finally, recommendations are given for organizations developing or maintaining record linkage programs, with an emphasis on organizations measuring long-term complications of disasters, such as 9/11.},

Airborne laser scanning data can be used to characterize these individual crowns, but analytical tools developed for boreal or temperate forests may require to be adjusted before they can be applied to tropical environments. Therefore, we compared results from six different segmentation methods applied to six plots (39 ha) from a study site in French Guiana. We measured the overlap of automatically segmented crowns projection with selected crowns manually delineated on high-resolution photography. We also evaluated the goodness of fit following automatic matching with field inventory data using a model linking tree diameter to tree crown width. The different methods tested in this benchmark segmented highly different numbers of crowns having different characteristics. Segmentation methods based on the point cloud (AMS3D and Graph-Cut) globally outperformed methods based on the Canopy Height Models, especially for small crowns; the AMS3D method outperformed the other methods tested for the overlap analysis, and AMS3D and Graph-Cut performed the best for the automatic matching validation. Nevertheless, other methods based on the Canopy Height Model performed better for very large emergent crowns. The dense foliage of tropical moist forests prevents sufficient point densities in the understory to segment subcanopy trees accurately, regardless of the segmentation method.},

Here, we examine the potential for combining airborne laser scanning (ALS) with multispectral and hyperspectral data to improve the accuracy of tree crown segmentation at a study site in French Guiana. We combined an ALS point cloud clustering method with a spectral deep learning model to achieve 83\% accuracy at recognizing manually segmented reference crowns (with congruence {$>$}0.5). This method outperformed a two-step process that involved clustering the ALS point cloud and then using the logistic regression of hyperspectral distances to correct oversegmentation. We used this approach to map tree mortality from repeat surveys and show that the number of crowns identified in the first that intersected with height loss clusters was a good estimator of the number of dead trees in these areas. Our results demonstrate that multisensor data fusion improves the automatic segmentation of individual tree crowns and presents a promising avenue to study forest demography with repeated remote sensing acquisitions.},

We present and examine a novel modeling approach to improve prediction of AGB and estimate AGB growth using LiDAR data. The proposed model accommodates temporal misalignment between field measurements and remotely sensed data---a problem pervasive in such settings---by including multiple time-indexed measurements at plot locations to estimate AGB growth. We pursue a Bayesian modeling framework that allows for appropriately complex parameter associations and uncertainty propagation through to prediction. Specifically, we identify a space-varying coefficients model to predict and map AGB and its associated growth simultaneously. The proposed model is assessed using LiDAR data acquired from NASA Goddard's LiDAR, Hyper-spectral \& Thermal imager and field inventory data from the Penobscot Experimental Forest in Bradley, Maine. The proposed model outperformed the time-invariant counterpart models in predictive performance as indicated by a substantial reduction in root mean squared error. The proposed model adequately accounts for temporal misalignment through the estimation of forest AGB growth and accommodates residual spatial dependence. Results from this analysis suggest that future AGB models informed using remotely sensed data, such as LiDAR, may be improved by adapting traditional modeling frameworks to account for temporal misalignment and spatial dependence using random effects.},

Unfortunately, validating assumptions usually depends on the availability of tests tailored to the specific model of interest. A novel Bayesian goodness-of-fit hypothesis testing approach is presented for a broad class of regression models the response variable of which is univariate and continuous. The proposed approach relies on a suitable transformation of the response variable and a Bayesian prior induced by a predictor-dependent mixture model. Hypothesis testing is performed via Bayes factor, the asymptotic properties of which are discussed. The method is implemented by means of a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, and its performance is illustrated using simulated and real data sets.},

However, as noted in the seminal paper of Goulard et~al. (Scand J Stat 23:365--379, 1996), such an assumption is not realistic in many situations. For example, a stand of forest may have many more small trees than large, hence the model should allow for a higher density of points with small marks. In addition, as suggested by Ogata and Tanemura (Biometrics 41:421--433, 1985), the interaction between points should be a function of their mark, allowing, for example, the range of interaction for large trees to exceed that of smaller trees. The aforementioned articles use frequentist inferential techniques, but interval estimation presents difficulties due to the extremely complex distributional properties of the estimates; it might be possible, however, to use parametric bootstrap methodology for such inferences (Baddeley et~al. in J Roy Stat Soc Ser B 67:617--666, 2005). We suggest the use of Bayesian inferential techniques. Although a Bayesian approach requires a complex, computational implementation of (reversible jump) Markov Chain Monte Carlo methodology, it enables a wide variety of inferences (including interval estimation). We demonstrate our approach by analyzing the well known Norway spruce dataset.},

  abstract = {Averages of proper scoring rules are often used to rank probabilistic forecasts. In many cases, the individual terms in these averages are based on observations and forecasts from different distributions. We show that some of the most popular proper scoring rules, such as the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS), give more importance to observations with large uncertainty which can lead to unintuitive rankings. To describe this issue, we define the concept of local scale invariance for scoring rules. A new class of generalized proper kernel scoring rules is derived and as a member of this class we propose the scaled CRPS (SCRPS). This new proper scoring rule is locally scale invariant and therefore works in the case of varying uncertainty. Like CRPS it is computationally available for output from ensemble forecasts, and does not require the ability to evaluate densities of forecasts. We further define robustness of scoring rules, show why this also is an important concept for average scores, and derive new proper scoring rules that are robust against outliers. The theoretical findings are illustrated in three different applications from spatial statistics, stochastic volatility models, and regression for count data.},

In this study, species-specific models for predicting individual diameter at breast height (dbh) and total tree height (h) growth were developed for 30 tree species growing in mixed and uneven-aged forest stands in Durango, Mexico. Growth models were also developed for all pine, all oaks, and all other species of the genus Arbutus (strawberry trees). A database of 55,158 trees with remeasurements of dbh and h of a 5-year growth period was used to develop the models. The data were collected from 217 stem-mapped plots located in the Sierra Madre Occidental (Mexico). Weighted regression was used to remove heteroscedasticity from the species-specific dbh and h growth models using a power function of the tree size independent variables. The final models developed in the present study to predict dbh and total tree height growth included size variables, site factors, and competition variables in their formulation. The developed models fitted the data well and explained between 98 and 99\% and of the observed variation of dbh, and between 77 and 98\% of the observed variation of total tree height for the studied species and groups of species. The developed models can be used for estimating the individual dbh and h growth for the analyzed species and can be integrated in decision support tools for management planning in these mixed forest ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Climate is widely assumed to influence physiological and demographic processes in trees, and hence forest composition, biomass and range limits. Growth in trees is an important barometer of climate change impacts on forests as growth is highly correlated with other demographic processes including tree mortality and fecundity. We investigated the main drivers of diameter growth for five common tree species occurring in the Rocky Mountains of the western United States using nonlinear regression methods. We quantified growth at the individual tree level from tree core samples collected across broad environmental gradients. We estimated the effects of both climate variation and biotic interactions on growth processes and tested for evidence that disjunct populations of a species respond differentially to climate. Relationships between tree growth and climate varied by species and location. Growth in all species responded positively to increases in annual moisture up to a threshold level. Modest linear responses to temperature, both positive and negative, were observed at many sites. However, model results also revealed evidence for differentiated responses to local site conditions in all species. In severe environments in particular, growth responses varied nonlinearly with temperature. For example, in northerly cold locations pronounced positive growth responses to increasing temperatures were observed. In warmer southerly climates, growth responses were unimodal, declining markedly above a threshold temperature level. Net effects from biotic interactions on diameter growth were negative for all study species. Evidence for facilitative effects was not detected. For some species, competitive effects more strongly influenced growth performance than climate. Competitive interactions also modified growth responses to climate to some degree. Synthesis. These analyses suggest that climate change will have complex, species-specific effects on tree growth in the Rocky Mountains due to nonlinear responses to climate, differentiated growth processes that vary by location and complex species interactions that impact growth and potentially modify responses to climate. Thus, robust model simulations of future growth responses to climate trends may need to integrate realistic scenarios of neighbourhood effects as well as variability in tree performance attributed to differentiated populations.},

  abstract = {Abstract Dynamic vegetation models (DVMs) are important tools to understand and predict the functioning and dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems under changing environmental conditions. In these models, uncertainty in the description of demographic processes, in particular tree mortality, is a persistent problem. Current mortality formulations lack realism and are insufficiently constrained by empirical evidence. It has been suggested that empirically estimated mortality submodels would enhance DVM performance, but due to the many processes and interactions within a DVM, the claim has rarely been tested. Here, we compare the performance of three alternative growth-dependent tree mortality submodels in the DVM ForClim: (1) a mortality function with theoretical foundation (ForClim v3.3); (2) a mortality function with parameters directly estimated based on forest inventory data; and (3) the same function, but with parameters estimated using an inverse approach through Bayesian calibration (BC). Time series of inventory data from 30 ecologically distinct Swiss natural forest reserves collected over 35+ yr, including the main tree species of Central Europe, were used for the calibration and subsequent validation of the mortality functions and the DVM. The recalibration resulted in mortality parameters that differed from the direct empirical estimates, particularly for the relationship between tree size and mortality. The calibrated parameters outperformed the direct estimates, and to a lesser extent the original mortality function, for predicting decadal-scale forest dynamics at both calibration and validation sites. The same pattern was observed regarding the plausibility of their long-term projections under contrasting environmental conditions. Our results demonstrate that inverse calibration may be useful even when direct empirical estimates of DVM parameters are available, as structural model deficiencies or data problems can result in discrepancies between direct and inverse estimates. Thus, we interpret the good performance of the inversely calibrated model for long-term projections (which were not a calibration target) as evidence that the calibration did not compensate for model errors. Rather, we surmise that the discrepancy was mainly caused by a lack of representativeness of the mortality data. Our results underline the potential for learning more about elusive processes, such as tree mortality or recruitment, through data integration in DVMs.},

This creates the opportunity to examine the relative contributions of within-species and across-species variation on tropical tree mortality rates, but also how species traits affect each hazard. We parameterize this model using \&gt;400,000 observed survival records collected over a 15-y period at Barro Colorado Island, Panama from more than 180,000 individuals across 203 species. We show that marginal carbon budgets are a major contributor to tree death on Barro Colorado Island. Moreover, we found that while species' light demand, maximum diameter at breast height (dbh), and wood density affected tree mortality in different ways, they explained only a small fraction of the total variability observed among species. Tree death drives population dynamics, nutrient cycling, and evolution within plant communities. Mortality variation across species is thought to be influenced by different factors relative to variation within species. The unified model provided here separates mortality rates into growth-dependent and growth-independent hazards. This model creates the opportunity to simultaneously estimate these hazards both across and within species. Moreover, it provides the ability to examine how species traits affect growth-dependent and growth-independent hazards. We derive this unified mortality model using cross-validated Bayesian methods coupled with mortality data collected over three census intervals for 203 tropical rainforest tree species at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. We found that growth-independent mortality tended to be higher in species with lower wood density, higher light requirements, and smaller maximum diameter at breast height (dbh). Mortality due to marginal carbon budget as measured by near-zero growth rate tended to be higher in species with lower wood density and higher light demand. The total mortality variation attributable to differences among species was large relative to variation explained by these traits, emphasizing that much remains to be understood. This additive hazards model strengthens our capacity to parse and understand individual-level mortality in highly diverse tropical forests and hence to predict its consequences.},

This novel class of models provides a useful generalization of the symmetrical nonlinear regression models since the error distributions cover both skewness and heavy-tailed distributions such as the skew-t, skew-slash and the skew-contaminated normal distributions. The main advantage of these class of distributions is that they have a nice hierarchical representation that allows the implementation of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to simulate samples from the joint posterior distribution. In order to examine the robust aspects of this flexible class, against outlying and influential observations, we present a Bayesian case deletion influence diagnostics based on the Kullback--Leibler divergence. Further, some discussions on the model selection criteria are given. The newly developed procedures are illustrated considering two simulations study, and a real data previously analyzed under normal and skew-normal nonlinear regression models.},

From annual measurements on a few trees (e.g., increment cores) or sporadic measurements from many trees (e.g., diameter censuses on mapped plots), relationships with resources, tree size, and climate are extrapolated to whole stands. There has been no way to formally integrate different types of data and problems of estimation that result from (1) multiple sources of observation error, which frequently result in impossible estimates of negative growth, (2) the fact that data are typically sparse (a few trees or a few years), whereas inference is needed broadly (many trees over many years), (3) the fact that some unknown fraction of the variance is shared across the population, and (4) the fact that growth rates of trees within competing stands are not independent. We develop a hierarchical Bayes state space model for tree growth that addresses all of these challenges, allowing for formal inference that is consistent with the available data and the assumption that growth is nonnegative. Prediction follows directly, incorporating the full uncertainty from inference with scenarios for "filling the gaps" for past growth rates and for future conditions affecting growth. An example involving multiple species and multiple stands with tree-ring data and up to 14 years of tree census data illustrates how different levels of information at the tree and stand level contribute to inference and prediction.},

Although correlation functions do describe spatial variability at distinct range of scale, they are clearly restricted to the analysis of few dominant species since they are based on pairwise analysis. This has over-simplified the spatial analysis of complex forest dynamics involving ``large'' number of species. Moreover, although process models can reproduce, to some extent, real forest spatial patterns of trees, the biological forest-ecological interpretation of the resulting spatial structures is difficult since these models usually lack of biological realism. This problem gains in strength as usually most of these point process models are defined in terms of purely spatial relationships, though in real life, forest develop through time. We thus aim to discuss the applicability of such formulations to analyse and simulate ``real'' forest dynamics and unwrap their shortcomes. We present a unified approach of modern spatially explicit forest growth models. Finally, we focus on a continuous space-time stochastic process as an alternative approach to generate marked point patterns evolving through space and time.

  abstract = {Tropical forests are a key component of the global carbon cycle, and mapping their carbon density is essential for understanding human influences on climate and for ecosystem-service-based payments for forest protection. Discrete-return airborne laser scanning (ALS) is increasingly recognised as a high-quality technology for mapping tropical forest carbon, because it generates 3D point clouds of forest structure from which aboveground carbon density (ACD) can be estimated. Area-based models are state of the art when it comes to estimating ACD from ALS data, but discard tree-level information contained within the ALS point cloud. This paper compares area-based and tree-centric models for estimating ACD in lowland old-growth forests in Sabah, Malaysia. These forests are challenging to map because of their immense height. We compare the performance of (a) an area-based model developed by Asner and Mascaro (2014), and used primarily in the neotropics hitherto, with (b) a tree-centric approach that uses a new algorithm (itcSegment) to locate trees within the ALS canopy height model, measures their heights and crown widths, and calculates biomass from these dimensions. We find that Asner and Mascaro's model needed regional calibration, reflecting the distinctive structure of Southeast Asian forests. We also discover that forest basal area is closely related to canopy gap fraction measured by ALS, and use this finding to refine Asner and Mascaro's model. Finally, we show that our tree-centric approach is less accurate at estimating ACD than the best-performing area-based model (RMSE 18\% vs 13\%). Tree-centric modelling is appealing because it is based on summing the biomass of individual trees, but until algorithms can detect understory trees reliably and estimate biomass from crown dimensions precisely, areas-based modelling will remain the method of choice.},

  abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data acquired from airborne or spaceborne platforms have revolutionized measurement and mapping of forest attributes. Airborne data are often either acquired using multiple overlapped flight lines to provide complete coverage of an area of interest, or using transects to sample a given population. Spaceborne lidar datasets are unique to each sensor and are sample- or profile-based with characteristics driven by acquisition mode and orbital parameters. To leverage the wealth of accurate vegetation structural data from these lidar systems, a number of approaches have been developed to extend these observations over broader areas, from local landscapes to the globe. In this review we examine studies that have utilised modelling approaches to extend air- or space-based lidar data with the aim of communicating methods, outcomes, and accuracies, and offering guidance on linking lidar metrics and lidar-derived forest attributes with broad-area predictors. Modelling approaches are developed for a variety of applications. In some cases, generation of spatially-exhaustive layers may be useful for forest management purposes, driving management and inventory decisions over smaller focus areas or regions. In other cases, outputs are designed for monitoring at regional or global scales, and may be -- due to the spatial grain of the structural estimates -- insufficiently accurate or reliable for management. From the reviewed studies, we found height, aboveground biomass and volume, derived from either upper proportions of a large-footprint full-waveform lidar profiles, or statistically modelled from discrete return small-footprint lidar point clouds, to be the most commonly extended forest attributes, followed by canopy cover, basal area and stand complexity. Assessment of the accuracy and bias of the extrapolated forest attributes varied with both independent and model-derived estimates. The coefficient of determination (R2) was the most often reported, followed by absolute and relative (i.e., as a proportion of the mean) root mean square error (RMSE and RMSE\% respectively). Compilation of the stated accuracies suggested that the variance explained in predictions of forest height ranged from R2~=~0.38 to 0.90 (mean~=~0.64), RMSE from 2 to 6m and RMSE\% from 12 to 34\%. For volume, R2 ranged from 0.25 to 0.72 (mean~=~0.53) and RMSE from 60 to 87 m3/ha and for aboveground biomass (AGB) R2 ranged from 0.35 to 0.78 (mean~=~0.55) and RMSE from 28 to 44~Mg/ha. There was no consensus on the level of accuracy required to support successful extension over larger areas. Ultimately, the review suggests that the information need motivating the spatial extension over larger areas drives the choice of the type of lidar data, spatial datasets and related grain. We conclude by discussing future directions and the outlook for new approaches including new lidar-derived response variables, advances in modelling approaches, and assessment of change.},

These models are often referred to as `tree models' because they are based on the birth, growth and death of individual trees, and the characteristics of individual trees are aggregated to describe the stand. This paper distinguishes between two types of models based upon their major purpose for development and data requirements. Forest growth models are defined as those used to assess the yield of a managed forest under prescribed conditions and usually require large calibration data sets. Community dynamics models are defined as those applied to ecological questions about the feedback of environment and species characteristics on growth and yield, and have species-specific rather than site-specific data requirements. The structure and data requirements for each model type affects their regional and temporal applicability as well as their predictive value. A combination approach using the two types of models may be t the most general model of tree growth and stand development.},

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data sets are increasingly recognized as outstanding data sources for high-fidelity mapping of carbon stocks at regional scales. We develop a tree-centric approach to carbon mapping, based on identifying individual tree crowns (ITCs) and species from airborne remote sensing data, from which individual tree carbon stocks are calculated. We identify ITCs from the laser scanning point cloud using a region-growing algorithm and identifying species from airborne hyperspectral data by machine learning. For each detected tree, we predict stem diameter from its height and crown-width estimate. From that point on, we use well-established approaches developed for field-based inventories: above-ground biomasses of trees are estimated using published allometries and summed within plots to estimate carbon density. We show this approach is highly reliable: tests in the Italian Alps demonstrated a close relationship between field- and ALS-based estimates of carbon stocks (r2 = 0{$\cdot$}98). Small trees are invisible from the air, and a correction factor is required to accommodate this effect. An advantage of the tree-centric approach over existing area-based methods is that it can produce maps at any scale and is fundamentally based on field-based inventory methods, making it intuitive and transparent. Airborne laser scanning, hyperspectral sensing and computational power are all advancing rapidly, making it increasingly feasible to use ITC approaches for effective mapping of forest carbon density also inside wider carbon mapping programs like REDD++.},

  abstract = {We have considered a Bayesian approach for the nonlinear regression model by replacing the normal distribution on the error term by some skewed distributions, which account for both skewness and heavy tails or skewness alone. The type of data considered in this paper concerns repeated measurements taken in time on a set of individuals. Such multiple observations on the same individual generally produce serially correlated outcomes. Thus, additionally, our model does allow for a correlation between observations made from the same individual. We have illustrated the procedure using a data set to study the growth curves of a clinic measurement of a group of pregnant women from an obstetrics clinic in Santiago, Chile. Parameter estimation and prediction were carried out using appropriate posterior simulation schemes based in Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Besides the deviance information criterion (DIC) and the conditional predictive ordinate (CPO), we suggest the use of proper scoring rules based on the posterior predictive distribution for comparing models. For our data set, all these criteria chose the skew-t model as the best model for the errors. These DIC and CPO criteria are also validated, for the model proposed here, through a simulation study. As a conclusion of this study, the DIC criterion is not trustful for this kind of complex model.},

Methods               Linked English national Hospital Episode Statistics and mortality data (1999--2011) were used to conduct a retrospective cohort study. A cohort of individuals admitted for hospital care with a coded diagnosis of T2DM was constructed, and compared to a reference cohort. Subsequent PD risk was estimated using Cox regression models. Individuals with a coded diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease, vascular parkinsonism, drug-induced parkinsonism, and normal pressure hydrocephalus were excluded from the analysis.                                         Results                                A total of 2,017,115 individuals entered the T2DM cohort and 6,173,208 entered the reference cohort. There were significantly elevated rates of PD following T2DM (hazard ratio [HR] 1.32, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.29--1.35;                 p                 {$<$} 0.001). The relative increase was greater in those with complicated T2DM (HR 1.49, 95\% CI 1.42--1.56) and when comparing younger individuals (HR 3.81, 95\% CI 2.84--5.11 in age group 25--44 years).

  abstract = {In spatial regression models, collinearity between covariates and spatial effects can lead to significant bias in effect estimates. This problem, known as spatial confounding, is encountered modeling forestry data to assess the effect of temperature on tree health. Reliable inference is difficult as results depend on whether or not spatial effects are included in the model. We propose a novel approach, spatial+, for dealing with spatial confounding when the covariate of interest is spatially dependent but not fully determined by spatial location. Using a thin plate spline model formulation we see that, in this case, the bias in covariate effect estimates is a direct result of spatial smoothing. Spatial+ reduces the sensitivity of the estimates to smoothing by replacing the covariates by their residuals after spatial dependence has been regressed away. Through asymptotic analysis we show that spatial+ avoids the bias problems of the spatial model. This is also demonstrated in a simulation study. Spatial+ is straightforward to implement using existing software and, as the response variable is the same as that of the spatial model, standard model selection criteria can be used for comparisons. A major advantage of the method is also that it extends to models with non-Gaussian response distributions. Finally, while our results are derived in a thin plate spline setting, the spatial+ methodology transfers easily to other spatial model formulations.},

The use of Monte Carlo estimation strategies in complicated Bayesian settings leads naturally to the use of importance sampling techniques to assess the divergence between full-data and case-deleted posteriors and to provide estimates under the case-deleted posteriors. However, the dependability of the importance sampling estimators depends critically on the variability of the case-deleted weights. We provide theoretical results concerning the assessment of the dependability of case-deleted importance sampling estimators in several Bayesian models. In particular, these results allow us to establish whether or not the estimators satisfy a central limit theorem. Because the conditions we derive are of a simple analytical nature, the assessment of the dependability of the estimators can be verified routinely before estimation is performed. We illustrate the use of the results in several examples.},

The plots' historical management records and site conditions are the same, but their last thinning treatment differs. Observed diameter increment at tree-level is investigated in relation to treatment. Individual tree growth residuals of tested models are evaluated in relation to tree diameter, treatment, projection length and sensitivity to the predictor mean stand age. Furthermore, the relations between displayed residuals and basal area local competition are analysed. The analyses indicate that active thinning made annual diameter increment independent of tree diameter above a threshold level, while the absence of thinning supported a concave relationship. All tested models displayed a significant linear bias leading to overestimation of small trees' growth and increasing underestimations of larger trees' growth with tree diameter. All distance-independent models displayed residual trends related to local competition.},

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

  abstract = {Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distributionF if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G {$\neq$} F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage.},

  abstract = {An important problem in shape analysis is to match configurations of points in space after filtering out some geometrical transformation. In this paper we introduce hierarchical models for such tasks, in which the points in the configurations are either unlabelled or have at most a partial labelling constraining the matching, and in which some points may only appear in one of the configurations. We derive procedures for simultaneous inference about the matching and the transformation, using a Bayesian approach. Our hierarchical model is based on a Poisson process for hidden true point locations; this leads to considerable mathematical simplification and efficiency of implementation of EM and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. We find a novel use for classical distributions from directional statistics in a conditionally conjugate specification for the case where the geometrical transformation includes an unknown rotation. Throughout, we focus on the case of affine or rigid motion transformations. Under a broad parametric family of loss functions, an optimal Bayesian point estimate of the matching matrix can be constructed that depends only on a single parameter of the family. Our methods are illustrated by two applications from bioinformatics. The first problem is of matching protein gels in two dimensions, and the second consists of aligning active sites of proteins in three dimensions. In the latter case, we also use information related to the grouping of the amino acids, as an example of a more general capability of our methodology to include partial labelling information. We discuss some open problems and suggest directions for future work.},

These costs were studied using costs of services from Medicare claims and cause of death (CoD) from death certificates. In the absence of a unique identifier linking the two datasets, common variables identified unique matches for only 33\% of deaths. The remaining cases formed cells with multiple cases (32\% in cells with an equal number of cases from each file and 35\% in cells with an unequal number). We sampled from the joint posterior distribution of model parameters and the permutations that link cases from the two files within each cell. The linking models included the regression of location of death on CoD and other parameters, and the regression of cost measures with a monotone missing data pattern on CoD and other demographic characteristics. Permutations were sampled by enumerating the exact distribution for small cells and by the Metropolis algorithm for large cells. Sparse matrix data structures enabled efficient calculations despite the large dataset ({$\approx$}1.7 million cases). The procedure generates m datasets in which the matches between the two files are imputed. The m datasets can be analyzed independently and results can be combined using Rubin's multiple imputation rules. Our approach can be applied in other file-linking applications.

This paper's primary goal is to assess the impact of various state-of-the-art C/C++ compilers available for novel AMD EPYC Rome and Milan multi-core processors on the performance of real-world scientific codes corresponding to the solidification modeling application using the PF method and generalized finite difference scheme for solving governing PDEs. Among the studied compilers are AOCC, Clang, GCC, Intel compiler, and PGI. Besides performance, the numerical accuracy of the simulation is verified since various optimizations used by the compilers can cause differences in the simulation results. For the objectivity of the assessment, we study different application versions with the increasing complexity of memory access patterns and control structures. All tested codes are executed on a dual-socket server equipped with 64-core AMD EPYC Rome 7742 CPUs. This assessment confirms the advantage of the Intel compiler over other compilers. In particular, while for the static intensity only GCC lags noticeably behind other compilers, in the case of the dynamic intensity, the clear winner is the Intel compiler, which allows increasing the performance up to about 1.3 times over the AMD compiler. Moreover, we reveal the sensitivity of the application version and compiler to selecting a different number of NUMA domains and enabling/disabling the NUMA balancing option in EPYC processors. By comparing the performance gain achieved by various compilers due to vectorization of the application codes, we show that the Intel compiler's performance advantage results primarily from considerably better utilization of capabilities of AVX2 vector instructions. Finally, we show the importance of choosing a compiler when comparing the performance of AMD EPYC and Intel Xeon processors.},

We show that adding a spatially-correlated error term to a linear model is equivalent to adding a saturated collection of canonical regressors, the coefficients of which are shrunk toward zero, where the spatial map determines both the canonical regressors and the relative extent of the coefficients' shrinkage. Adding a spatially-correlated error term can also be seen as inflating the error variances associated with specific contrasts of the data, where the spatial map determines the contrasts and the extent of error-variance inflation. We show how to avoid this spatial confounding by restricting the spatial random effect to the orthogonal complement (residual space) of the fixed effects, which we call restricted spatial regression. We consider five proposed interpretations of spatial confounding and draw implications about what, if anything, one should do about it. In doing so, we debunk the common belief that adding a spatially-correlated random effect adjusts fixed-effect estimates for spatially-structured missing covariates.

The methods are divided into the following categories: extraction of terrain and canopy height model; feature extraction approaches (canopy height distribution and individual-tree-based techniques, techniques based on the synergetic use of aerial images and lidar, and other new approaches); tree species classification and forest growth using laser scanner; and the use of intensity and waveform data in forest information extraction. Despite this, the focus is on methods, some review of quality obtained, especially in the boreal forest area, is included. Several recommendations for future research are given to foster the methodology development.}

Metabolic scaling theory predicted that the 2/3 power of stem diameter at a certain time is a linear function of the 2/3 power of the initial diameter and that the diameter growth rate scales to the 1/3 power of the initial diameter. We tested these predictions of the metabolic scaling theory for 11 Japanese secondary forests at various growth stages. The predictions were not supported by the data, especially in younger stands. Alternatively, we proposed a new theoretical model for stem diameter growth on the basis of six assumptions. All these assumptions were supported by the data. The model produced a nearly linear to curvilinear relationship between the 2/3 power of stem diameters at two different times. It also fitted well to the curvilinear relationship between diameter growth rate and the initial diameter. Our model fitted better than the metabolic scaling theory, suggesting the importance of asymmetric competition among trees, which has not been incorporated in the metabolic scaling theory.},

This work concentrates on delineating individual trees in topographically-complex, mixed conifer forest across the California's Sierra Nevada. We delineated individual trees using vector data and a 3D lidar point cloud segmentation algorithm, and using raster data with an object-based image analysis (OBIA) of a canopy height model (CHM). The two approaches are compared to each other and to ground reference data. We used high density (9 pulses/m2), discreet lidar data and WorldView-2 imagery to delineate individual trees, and to classify them by species or species types. We also identified a new method to correct artifacts in a high-resolution CHM. Our main focus was to determine the difference between the two types of approaches and to identify the one that produces more realistic results. We compared the delineations via tree detection, tree heights, and the shape of the generated polygons. The tree height agreement was high between the two approaches and the ground data (r2: 0.93--0.96). Tree detection rates increased for more dominant trees (8--100 percent). The two approaches delineated tree boundaries that differed in shape: the lidar-approach produced fewer, more complex, and larger polygons that more closely resembled real forest structure.},

In these forests, two species dominate the canopy which may influence tree regeneration. Ultimately, the outcomes of habitat filtering, competition, and disturbance manifest in spatial patterns of tree regeneration, including in longleaf pine ecosystems. Understanding regeneration and establishment patterns can aid in restoration efforts. We ask how the dominant species in an established longleaf pine forest are spatially arranged to provide insight into the mechanisms that may be driving tree establishment in longleaf pine forests. We found that longleaf pine saplings were more likely to be found near the other dominant tree species in this forest, turkey oak trees, than in gaps or near to longleaf pine trees. Similarly, turkey oak saplings clustered around turkey oak trees but were dispersed in relation to longleaf pine trees. These findings point towards the interplay between canopy tree composition, leaf litter, and fire behavior as driving mechanisms in the successful establishment of both pines and oaks in this forest.},

The common methods for estimating the height-diameter models have taken the classical (frequentist) approach based on the frequency interpretation of probability, for example, the nonlinear least squares method (NLS) and the maximum likelihood method (ML). The Bayesian method has an exclusive advantage compared with classical method that the parameters to be estimated are regarded as random variables. In this study, the classical and Bayesian methods were used to estimate six height-diameter models, respectively. Both the classical method and Bayesian method showed that the Weibull model was the \&\#x201c;best\&\#x201d; model using data1. In addition, based on the Weibull model, data2 was used for comparing Bayesian method with informative priors with uninformative priors and classical method. The results showed that the improvement in prediction accuracy with Bayesian method led to narrower confidence bands of predicted value in comparison to that for the classical method, and the credible bands of parameters with informative priors were also narrower than uninformative priors and classical method. The estimated posterior distributions for parameters can be set as new priors in estimating the parameters using data2.},

The method is an alternative to the cross-validation procedure of variable selection used in the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method and seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) with automatic selection of the features used in the model. This method is called the sparse Bayesian method. It does not suffer from overfitting thanks to the Bayesian formulation of the problem. The proposed method is applied to sample plot data obtained from inventory by compartments. The results show that the sparse Bayesian method performs as well as OLS and SUR methods, in terms of accuracy of total stand characteristics. The methods are comparable also in their demand for sample plot data. None of the methods lose much of their accuracy, even when just a few dozen sample plots are available. A Bayesian approach makes it possible to automate model formulation and sample plot selection processes. It is therefore possible to automatically generate a different model for intrastand strata, thus addressing intrastand variability. The proposed method automatically maintains a balance between the number of forest parameters and the rank of the model used to estimate them.},

  abstract = {Spatial statistical analysis of massive amounts of spatial data can be challenging because computation of optimal procedures can break down. The Spatial Random Effects (SRE) model uses a fixed number of known but not necessarily orthogonal (multiresolutional) spatial basis functions, which gives a flexible family of nonstationary covariance functions, results in dimension reduction, and yields optimal spatial predictors whose computations are scalable. By modeling spatial data in a hierarchical manner with a process model that includes the SRE model, the choice is whether to estimate the SRE model's parameters or to take a Bayesian approach and put a prior distribution on them. In this article, we develop Bayesian inference for the SRE model when the spatial basis functions are multiresolutional. Then the covariance matrix of the random effects decomposes naturally in terms of Givens angles and eigenvalues, for which a new class of prior distributions is developed. This approach to prior specification of a spatial covariance matrix offers remarkable improvement over other types of priors used in the random-effects literature (e.g., Wishart priors), as demonstrated in a simulation experiment. Further, a large remote-sensing dataset of aerosol optical depth (AOD), from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on the Terra satellite, is analyzed in a fully Bayesian framework, using the new prior, and compared to an empirical-Bayesian analysis.},

  abstract = {Entity resolution (ER), comprising record linkage and deduplication, is the process of merging noisy databases in the absence of unique identifiers to remove duplicate entities. One major challenge of analysis with linked data is identifying a representative record among determined matches to pass to an inferential or predictive task, referred to as the downstream task. Additionally, incorporating uncertainty from ER in the downstream task is critical to ensure proper inference. To bridge the gap between ER and the downstream task in an analysis pipeline, we propose five methods to choose a representative (or canonical) record from linked data, referred to as canonicalization. Our methods are scalable in the number of records, appropriate in general data scenarios, and provide natural error propagation via a Bayesian canonicalization stage. The proposed methodology is evaluated on three simulated datasets and one application -- determining the relationship between demographic information and party affiliation in voter registration data from the North Carolina State Board of Elections. We first perform Bayesian ER and evaluate our proposed methods for canonicalization before considering the downstream tasks of linear and logistic regression. Bayesian canonicalization methods are empirically shown to improve downstream inference in both settings through prediction and coverage.},

  abstract = {Spatial structure of forest stands is one of the main drivers of forest growth and yield, and is an important indicator of wildlife habitat, aesthetics, and other non-timber forest uses. Because spatial structure is costly to measure, a number of approaches for simulating spatial structures have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a simple approach that is capable of generating multispecies stand structures. Based on the method of copulas (Genest and MacKay, 1986, Am. Stat. 40:280--283), we utilize a normal copula to simulate spatially correlated stand structures. Species composition, diameter, height, and crown ratio distributions of each species, and their correlation with underlying spatial patterns are all controlled by user inputs. Example data sets are used to demonstrate how to estimate required parameters and compare simulated spatial structures with observed spatial structures. Except at the smallest scales ({$<$}10m in the longleaf pine dataset and {$<$}2m in the mixed Acadian Forest dataset), the simulated stand structures adequately captured the observed spatial patterns. Based on these comparisons, we conclude that the system is capable of simulating a range of forest stand spatial structures.},

  abstract = {In record linkage, or exact file matching, one compares two or more files on a single population for purposes of unduplication or production of an enhanced, merged database. Record linkage has many applications, including in population enumeration efforts, to create databases for epidemiological investigations, and to improve survey sample frames. Latent class and mixture models have been used to implement computerised record linkage of large databases. Probabilities that pairs of records, one record from each of two files, pertain to the same person (a match) or to different people (a nonmatch) are estimated based on model parameters and Bayes' theorem. In some settings, there is experience with similar record linkage operations that can inform prior opinions concerning model parameters. In this paper, Bayesian record linkage alternatives are developed. A hierarchical Bayesian model allows parameters to vary by file blocks, which are similar to geographical blocks in census applications. Techniques for incorporating 1-1 matching between files into the likelihood itself and computing posterior distributions of parameters and linkage indicators are presented.}

  abstract = {A growth model for uneven-aged mixed-conifer stands in California was developed with data from 205 permanent plots. The model predicts the number of softwood and hardwood trees in nineteen diameter classes, based on equations for diameter growth rates, mortality and recruitment. The model gave unbiased predictions of the expected number of trees by diameter class and species group over eight to twelve years, on 28 validation plots that were not used in model estimation. The results of predictions of undisturbed growth over more than a century were consistent with previous knowledge about succession and productivity in this forest type. The growth model, embedded in the CalPro simulator, was applied to project the effects of managing stands to maintain the current average stand state over the observed plots, with cutting cycles of ten or twenty years. The results suggested that uneven-aged management could match the productivity of even-aged systems. The ten-year cutting cycle led to higher productivity, higher present value of harvests, higher tree species diversity but lower tree size diversity than the twenty-year cycle.

  abstract = {The functional form W = (W0Kc + Wftc) /(Kc + tc), where W is body size at age t, W0 and Wf are the zero- and infinite-time values of W, respectively, and K and c are constants, is derived. This new generalized Michaelis-Menten-type equation provides a flexible model for animal growth capable of describing sigmoidal and diminishing returns behavior. The parameters of the nonlinear model are open to biological interpretation and can be used to calculate reliable estimates of growth traits, such as maximum or average postnatal growth rates. To evaluate the new model, the derived equation and standard growth functions such as the Gompertz and Richards were used to fit 83 growth data sets of different animal species (fish, mice, hamsters, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, broilers, turkeys, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and cattle) with a large range in body size. A comparative study was carried out based on mathematical, statistical, and biological characteristics of the models. The statistical goodness-of-fit achieved with the new model was similar to that of Richards, and both were slightly superior to the Gompertz. The new model differed from the others with respect to some of the estimated growth traits, but there were highly significant correlation coefficients between estimates obtained with the different models, and the ranking of animals based on growth parameters computed with the new function agreed with the rankings computed by the other models. Therefore, the new model, with its variable inflection point, was able to adequately describe growth in a wide variety of animals, to fit a range of data showing sigmoidal growth patterns, and to provide satisfactory estimates of traits for quantifying the growth characteristics of each type of animal.},

  abstract = {Spatial documentation is exponentially increasing given the availability of Big Data in the Internet of Things, enabled by device miniaturization and data storage capacity. Bayesian spatial statistics is a useful statistical tool to determine the dependence structure and hidden patterns in space through prior knowledge and data likelihood. However, this class of modeling is not yet well explored when compared to adopting classification and regression in machine-learning models, in which the assumption of the spatiotemporal independence of the data is often made, that is an inexistent or very weak dependence. Thus, this systematic review aims to address the main models presented in the literature over the past 20 years, identifying the gaps and research opportunities. Elements such as random fields, spatial domains, prior specification, the covariance function, and numerical approximations are discussed. This work explores the two subclasses of spatial smoothing: global and local.},

  abstract = {Recent technological advancements have seen a rapid growth in the use of imagery data to estimate the abundance and spatial distribution of animal populations. However, the value of imagery data may not be fully exploited under traditional analytical frameworks. We developed a method that leverages aerial imagery data for population modeling through entity resolution, a technique that stochastically links the same individual across multiple images. Resolving duplicate individuals in overlapping images that are distorted requires realigning observed point patterns optimally; however, popular machine learning algorithms for image stitching do not often account for alignment uncertainty. Moreover, duplicated individuals can provide insight about detection probability when overlaps are viewed as replicate surveys. Our model resolves individual identities by linking observed locations to latent activity centers and estimates total population as informed by the linkage structure. We developed a hierarchical framework to achieve entity resolution and abundance estimation cohesively, thereby avoiding single-direction error propagation that is common in two-stage models. We illustrate our method through simulation and a case study using aerial images of sea otters in Glacier Bay, Alaska. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line},

  abstract = {Entity resolution (ER; also known as record linkage or de-duplication) is the process of merging noisy databases, often in the absence of unique identifiers. A major advancement in ER methodology has been the application of Bayesian generative models, which provide a natural framework for inferring latent entities with rigorous quantification of uncertainty. Despite these advantages, existing models are severely limited in practice, as standard inference algorithms scale quadratically in the number of records. While scaling can be managed by fitting the model on separate blocks of the data, such a na{\textbackslash}"ive approach may induce significant error in the posterior. In this paper, we propose a principled model for scalable Bayesian ER, called "distributed Bayesian linkage" or d-blink, which jointly performs blocking and ER without compromising posterior correctness. Our approach relies on several key ideas, including: (i) an auxiliary variable representation that induces a partition of the entities and records into blocks; (ii) a method for constructing well-balanced blocks based on k-d trees; (iii) a distributed partially-collapsed Gibbs sampler with improved mixing; and (iv) fast algorithms for performing Gibbs updates. Empirical studies on six data sets---including a case study on the 2010 Decennial Census---demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {Spatial models are used in a variety research areas, such as environmental sciences, epidemiology, or physics. A common phenomenon in many spatial regression models is spatial confounding. This phenomenon takes place when spatially indexed covariates modeling the mean of the response are correlated with the spatial random effect. As a result, estimates for regression coefficients of the covariates can be severely biased and interpretation of these is no longer valid. Recent literature has shown that typical solutions for reducing spatial confounding can lead to misleading and counterintuitive results. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient spatial model in a Bayesian framework integrating novel prior structure that reduces spatial confounding. Starting from the univariate case, we extend our prior structure to case of multiple spatially confounded covariates. In a simulation study, we show that our novel model flexibly detects and reduces spatial confounding in spatial datasets, and it performs better than typically used methods such as restricted spatial regression. These results are promising for any applied researcher who wishes to interpret covariate effects in spatial regression models. As a real data illustration, we study the effect of elevation and temperature on the mean of daily precipitation in Germany.},

  abstract = {The LiDAR-derived Canopy height model (CHM), due to its wide applications in forestry, is important for foresters. Before a CHM can be considered a valuable, objective source of information about a canopy surface, it must be properly interpolated and preprocessed, which may sometimes be challenging, especially in case of multilayer and multispecies forest. This study tested and evaluated the impact of CHM interpolation methods on the accuracy of estimating tree height, which is one of the most important trees and stands feature. Tree heights calculated from 5 CHMs (1. raw CHM; 2. pit-free CHM; 3. spike-free CHM; 4. Smoothed CHM (with a median filter and with a Gaussian filter) were compared to heights measurements in the field. It was also tested whether applying linear regression can improve the accuracy of tree height estimations based on LiDAR-derived CHMs. The obtained results indicate that the method of generating CHMs influences the accuracy of tree height estimations. The mean differences between the means of field heights and LiDAR-derived heights (for each CHM separately and the 99th percentile) were statistically significant. The most accurate results were obtained with the spike-free CHM (RMSE calculated for all trees was 1.42\,m (5.80\%)). The smallest errors were observed for conifers--the RMSEs obtained for the spike-free CHM were 1.07\,m (3.75\%) and 1.18\,m (4.57\%) for spruce and pine, respectively. The use of linear regression improved the accuracy of tree height estimations from LiDAR data (especially for the CHMs filtered with Gaussian and median filters).},

These relationships depend heavily on species plasticity and local competition for light. It is however difficult to study forest canopies due to their inaccessibility and complexity. The objective of this study was thus to use terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data to overcome the limits of traditional canopy studies and to quantify the differences in sugar maple (Acer saccharum, Marsh.) tree crowns between stands with different composition and developmental stage. A total of 72 sugar maple trees and their immediate surroundings were scanned using a TLS. We developed eight crown structure metrics and three competition indices using TLS data. We found that competitive pressure is higher in pure stands, when compared to mixed ones. Sugar maple crowns were bigger, less dense, and more sinuous and open in mixed stands. Moreover, differences between trees were generally more pronounced for trees in mature stands. Finally, TLS competition indices are better predictors of crown metric variability than stand type, highlighting the potential of TLS data to quantify tree competition and space occupancy. Our competition indices are good proxies of the canopy structure and thus seem promising to predict tree growth.},

  abstract = {Record linkage is increasingly used to expand the information available for public health research. An understanding of record linkage methods and the relevant strengths and limitations is important for robust analysis and interpretation of linked data. Here, we describe the approach used by Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to link primary care data to other patient level datasets, and the potential implications of this approach for CPRD data analysis. General practice electronic health record software providers separately submit de-identified data to CPRD and patient identifiers to NHS Digital, excluding patients who have opted-out from contributing data. Data custodians for external datasets also send patient identifiers to NHS Digital. NHS Digital uses identifiers to link the datasets using an 8-stage deterministic methodology. CPRD subsequently receives a de-identified linked cohort file and provides researchers with anonymised linked data and metadata detailing the linkage process. This methodology has been used to generate routine primary care linked datasets, including data from Hospital Episode Statistics, Office for National Statistics and National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. 10.6~million (M) patients from 411 English general practices were included in record linkage in June 2018. 9.1M (86\%) patients were of research quality, of which 8.0M (88\%) had a valid NHS number and were eligible for linkage in the CPRD standard linked dataset release. Linking CPRD data to other sources improves the range and validity of research studies. This manuscript, together with metadata generated on match strength and linkage eligibility, can be used to inform study design and explore potential linkage-related selection and misclassification biases.},

Recent improvements in plant growth modelling have allowed deeper understanding and more accurate predictions for a wide range of ecological issues, including competition among plants, plant--herbivore interactions and ecosystem functioning. 2. One challenge in modelling plant growth is that, for a variety of reasons, relative growth rate (RGR) almost universally decreases with increasing size, although traditional calculations assume that RGR is constant. Nonlinear growth models are flexible enough to account for varying growth rates. 3. We demonstrate a variety of nonlinear models that are appropriate for modelling plant growth and, for each, show how to calculate function-derived growth rates, which allow unbiased comparisons among species at a common time or size. We show how to propagate uncertainty in estimated parameters to express uncertainty in growth rates. Fitting nonlinear models can be challenging, so we present extensive worked examples and practical recommendations, all implemented in R. 4. The use of nonlinear models coupled with function-derived growth rates can facilitate the testing of novel hypotheses in population and community ecology. For example, the use of such techniques has allowed better understanding of the components of RGR, the costs of rapid growth and the linkage between host and parasite growth rates. We hope this contribution will demystify nonlinear modelling and persuade more ecologists to use these techniques.},

Taking species or size into account leads to marked patterns. The question addressed is to model such multi-scale marked patterns using a single process. Within the category of Markov processes, the area-interaction process has the advantage of being locally stable, whether it is attractive or repulsive. This process was originally defined as a one-scale non-marked process. We propose an extension as a multi-scale marked process. Three examples are presented to show the adequacy of this process to model tree patterns: 1. A pine pattern showing anisotropic regularity and clustering at different scales. 2. A bivariate (adult/juvenile) kimboto pattern in French Guiana, showing regularity for one type, clustering for the other and repulsion between the two. 3. A marked pattern in Gabon where the mark is tree diameter.},

  abstract = {Juvenile tree survival will play an important role in the persistence of coniferous forests and woodlands in the southwestern United States (SWUS). Vulnerability to climatic and environmental stress declines as trees grow, such that larger, more deeply rooted juveniles are less likely to experience mortality. It is unclear how juvenile conifers partition the aboveground and belowground components of early growth, if growth differs between species and ecosystem types, and what environmental factors influence juvenile carbon allocation above- or belowground. We developed a novel data set for four juvenile conifer groups (junipers, pi{\~n}on pines, ponderosa pines, firs; 1121 juveniles sampled, 221 destructively) in three height classes ({$<$}150 mm, 150--300 mm, and 300+ mm), across 25 SWUS sites. We compared growth characteristics across groups and height classes and related differences to climatic and environmental factors. As tree height increased from {$<$}150 mm to 300+ mm, belowground growth increased, root:shoot ratio declined, and specific leaf area declined for all conifers except firs. Maximum rooting depth was shallower than previous estimates ({$<$}{\texttildelow}400 mm). Lower elevation juveniles were frequently located in sheltered microsites that provided high shading, whereas mid- and higher elevation juveniles were frequently unsheltered. Across all forest and woodland sites, herbaceous cover was positively correlated with aboveground growth. At study locations comprised of multiple sites, differences in aboveground growth were best explained by ecosystem type (pi{\~n}on pine-juniper woodland, ponderosa pine forest, mixed-conifer forest) and local environmental variation. Our results indicate generally more belowground early growth and more aboveground later growth, but specific allocation patterns varied among ecosystem (greater proportional shoot growth at lower and mid-elevations compared with higher elevations). Juvenile conifers had similar magnitudes of proportional growth across conifer groups, displaying limited capacity to acclimate growth to differences in climate that control ecosystem type. If juvenile conifers also do not acclimate physiologically to their environment, our findings suggest that local environmental variation will play a primary role in regulating forest and woodland persistence and modify the effects of climate change in the SWUS.},

  abstract = {We investigated the demography and spatial pattern of an old-growth longleaf pine population using a large plot in which all trees of at least 2 cm in dbh were mapped and tagged for individual recognition. The population was of uneven age and size; tree size correlated positively with tree age. Large or old trees were only loosely aggregated, forming a background matrix that filled the forest. In contrast, juvenile trees were highly aggregated and were located in areas of low adult densities. Recruitment within this population thus appears to occur primarily within open spaces created by the deaths of large trees. Variable time lags may occur before the colonization of open spaces, however, because of temporal variation in seed production and the occurrence of summer ground fires. The absence of large gaps within the age-class distribution indicated that recruitment within the mapped plot has occurred frequently for at least the past 250 years. Neither age- nor size-class distributions, however, were stable. Instead, temporal variation in adult mortality and recruitment into open spaces, coupled with strong negative interactions between cohorts of different ages, appears likely to produce alternating phases of population growth and decline that are highly variable in length and magnitude. An upper bound to population size occurs when all available space is filled with trees; but no lower bound exists, and extinction probabilities may be increased at very low densities. The population is buffered from declines to very low densities, however, by the consistent tendency for small trees to recruit into openings created by the deaths of adults. This regeneration pattern, which also occurs in other long-lived conifers, represents a spatial analogue to stochastic boundedness over time, and it may enhance the local persistence of longleaf pine populations. Efficient spatial buffering requires that open spaces not be colonized by other tree species before the establishment of longleaf recruits. We suggest that longleaf pine maintains the environment in an open state suitable for its own regeneration by transmuting a localized disturbance (lightning) into a widespread disturbance (ground fires). Fire facilitation results in an extended, but indefinite, increase in the persistence of environmental conditions in which longleaf pine, but not other tree species, can survive and reproduce. Since longleaf pine influences the fire regime, it is a key species that constitutes environmental conditions and, hence, the composition and relative abundances of other species within the habitat.},

Despite this, competition has dominated many ecological theories and the interpretation of density effects. Ongoing research in tree mechanics and in verifying the stress-gradient hypothesis reveal that our understanding of tree interactions is still incomplete. Promising research is currently underway attempting to uncover the physiological receptors and processes related to interaction whilst in the past largely plant performance, e.g. plant size and growth rates, was used for verifying competition. We give an overview of quantification methods and suggest a standardisation by common construction principles. Plant performance has been much used for providing empirical evidence of interactions, but when used in isolation it can be a confounding criterion leading to misinterpretations despite promising new developments in quantifying tree interaction. We therefore suggest using pattern-oriented modelling in analyses of tree interactions, where several plant traits are applied simultaneously.},

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) was found to be useful in measuring the structural properties associated with individual tree crowns. However, established ALS-assisted monitoring frameworks are still limited. The main objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of detecting species-specific individual tree crown growth by means of airborne laser scanning (ALS) measurements in 2009 (T1) and 2014 (T2). Our study was conducted in southern Finland over 91 sample plots with a size of 32 {\texttimes} 32 m. The ALS crown metrics of width (WD), projection area (A2D), volume (V), and surface area (A3D) were derived for species-specific individually matched trees in T1 and T2. The Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), and birch (Betula sp.) were the three species groups that studied. We found a high capability of bi-temporal ALS measurements in the detection of species-specific crown growth ({$\Delta$}), especially for the 3D crown metrics of V and A3D, with Cohen's D values of 1.09--1.46 (p-value {$<$} 0.0001). Scots pine was observed to have the highest relative crown growth (r{$\Delta$}) and showed statistically significant differences with Norway spruce and birch in terms of r{$\Delta$}WD, r{$\Delta$}A2D, r{$\Delta$}V, and r{$\Delta$}A3D at a 95\% confidence interval. Meanwhile, birch and Norway spruce had no statistically significant differences in r{$\Delta$}WD, r{$\Delta$}V, and r{$\Delta$}A3D (p-value {$<$} 0.0001). However, the amount of r{$\Delta$} variability that could be explained by the species was only 2--5\%. This revealed the complex nature of growth controlled by many biotic and abiotic factors other than species. Our results address the great potential of ALS data in crown growth detection that can be used for growth studies at large scales.},

This involves two nearest-neighbour methods for the identification of stand structures, i.e., the aggregation index R by Clark and Evans [Clark, Ph.J. and Evans, F.C., 1954. Distance to nearest neighbor as a measure of spatial relationships in populations. Ecology 35 (4) 445--453.] for univariate patterns and the segregation index S by Pielou [Pielou, E.C., 1977. Mathematical Ecology. Wiley.] for bivariate patterns. Both were used to describe the structure of 53 experimental plots of mixed beech-larch stands in Lower Saxony which provided the data base for this investigation. The second part of the study deals with the development of the STRUGEN stand structure generator, designed for the modeling and reproduction of spatial stand structures. To generate stand structures, a two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson process is used as well as a set of two-dimensional distribution functions which determine mixture type and intermingling intensity of main and associated tree species. Moreover, a distance function secures minimum distances between competing neighbouring trees. Consequently, the produced pattern is the result of a combination of an inhomogeneous Poisson process (for generating mixture units) and a hard-core process (for securing minimum distances between neighbours). The STRUGEN generator was designed and successfully used for the investigation of 53 mixed beech-larch stands. It provides initial values and stand structures for distance-dependent single-tree models from estimated qualitative stand characteristics. STRUGEN is a useful tool and allows initial, pragmatic steps towards fully utilising available qualitative and quantitative information to diagnose the state of a forest and to predict its growth.},

  abstract = {The course of tree growth, especially the level and persistence until advanced age, indicates the competitivenes and fitness of trees and determines stand structure and dynamics. The velocity of size growth and aging affects many other plants and animals living at and from trees. Thus forestry and many ecosystem functions and services are depending on the course of tree growth. First, novel empirical findings of particular persisting tree growth in various parts of the world were presented and motivated this review. The revealed increasing, mostly positive, deviations of observed from theoretically expected tree growth directed this review to be based on literature and own long-term experiments, stem analyses, and increment cores from temperate forests. Second, the common growth theory and respective growth equations were revisited; they later were used for analyzing observed courses of dominant trees' mass growth and productivity. Third, tree developments over size and age were analyzed as affected by tree species, site conditions, thinning, and fertilization and enviromental changes. Stem analyses and increment core analyses of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) representing the growth from 1560 to 1882 indicated a persistence of volume growth beyond age of 300\,years even in this historic period of comparatively steady environmental conditions. The mass growth of 735 dominant trees revealed mean culmination ages between 211 and 480\,years with the ranking sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.)\,{$>$}\,European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.)\,{$>$}\,Norway spruce\,{$>$}\,Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Trees on sites with high site index grew quicker, peaked, and decreased earlier in annual growth, whereas trees on poor sites culminated later in terms of age. The courses of annual growth in dependence on tree mass ran more synchronous on different sites. They differed much more in the level than in the rhythm. A total of 910 Scots pines on combined thinned and fertilized compared with control plots revealed for both groups a continous increase of growth until high ages and no preponed size-related growth decrease of the treated trees. For analyzing any modification of the course of growth by environmental changes I used a dataset of 591 cored European beeches and for corroboration 580 permanantly surveyed tree from long-term experiments of the four above mentiond main tree species in Europe. On top of their long-lasting growth all species together showed a strong acceleration of annual growth. Their growth acceleration was obviously caused by environmental changes and the highest in 1850 to 1900. It lessend in the last 50\,years, and did not trigger any preponed age- or size related decrease. Finally, I discussed the consequences of the amazingly high and long-lasting tree growth for forest ecology, management and future research.},

Conditioning on a single selected model ignores model uncertainty, and thus leads to the underestimation of uncertainty when making inferences about quantities of interest. A Bayesian solution to this problem involves averaging over all possible models (i.e., combinations of predictors) when making inferences about quantities of interest. This approach is often not practical. In this article we offer two alternative approaches. First, we describe an ad hoc procedure, ``Occam's window,'' which indicates a small set of models over which a model average can be computed. Second, we describe a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach that directly approximates the exact solution. In the presence of model uncertainty, both of these model averaging procedures provide better predictive performance than any single model that might reasonably have been selected. In the extreme case where there are many candidate predictors but no relationship between any of them and the response, standard variable selection procedures often choose some subset of variables that yields a high R 2 and a highly significant overall F value. In this situation, Occam's window usually indicates the null model (or a small number of models including the null model) as the only one (or ones) to be considered thus largely resolving the problem of selecting significant models when there is no signal in the data. Software to implement our methods is available from StatLib.},

Bayesian posterior samples for the latent allocation variables can be effectively obtained in a wide range of clustering models, including finite mixtures, infinite mixtures, hidden Markov models and block models for networks. However, due to the categorical nature of the clustering variables and the lack of scalable algorithms, summary tools that can interpret such samples are not available. We adopt a Bayesian decision theoretical approach to define an optimality criterion for clusterings and propose a fast and context-independent greedy algorithm to find the best allocations. One important facet of our approach is that the optimal number of groups is automatically selected, thereby solving the clustering and the model-choice problems at the same time. We consider several loss functions to compare partitions and show that our approach can accommodate a wide range of cases. Finally, we illustrate our approach on both artificial and real datasets for three different clustering models: Gaussian mixtures, stochastic block models and latent block models for networks.},

Herein, we demonstrate the importance of assessing and harmonizing the vertical alignment of multi-temporal ALS data sets used for height growth calculations. Using four ALS acquisitions (2005--2018) in a temperate mixedwood forest, we developed an ALS data harmonization approach and quantified the impact of the harmonization on derived height periodic annual increment (PAI), comparing the ALS-derived PAI to PAI derived from non-harmonized ALS data sets and field measurements. We found significant differences in PAI derived from harmonized and non-harmonized data, and these differences were greater for shorter growth intervals. Data harmonization resulted in a consistent PAI series that reduced uncertainties associated with the different ALS acquisitions. Although overall there was a strong relationship between field and ALS height measures (R2~{$\geq~$}0.88), we found a weak relationship between the field- and ALS-derived PAI (R2~=~0.12). We identified systematic errors in field-based tree height measures in plots with complex crowns, tall trees, and restricted visibility. We demonstrate the need for harmonizing multi-temporal ALS data sets for the generation of PAI and, likewise, highlight the need of carefully scrutinize field-measured heights and associated increments.},

  abstract = {Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing technology known for its applicability in natural resources management. By quantifying the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and underlying terrain using laser technology, ALS has been used extensively for enhancing geospatial knowledge in the fields of forestry and ecology. Structural descriptions of vegetation provide a means of estimating a range of ecologically pertinent attributes, such as height, volume, and above-ground biomass. The efficient processing of large, often technically complex datasets requires dedicated algorithms and software. The continued promise of ALS as a tool for improving ecological understanding is often dependent on user-created tools, methods, and approaches. Due to the proliferation of ALS among academic, governmental, and private-sector communities, paired with requirements to address a growing demand for open and accessible data, the ALS community is recognising the importance of free and open-source software (FOSS) and the importance of user-defined workflows. Herein, we describe the philosophy behind the development of the lidR package. Implemented in the R environment with a C/C++ backend, lidR is free, open-source and cross-platform software created to enable simple and creative processing workflows for forestry and ecology communities using ALS data. We review current algorithms used by the research community, and in doing so raise awareness of current successes and challenges associated with parameterisation and common implementation approaches. Through a detailed description of the package, we address the key considerations and the design philosophy that enables users to implement user-defined tools. We also discuss algorithm choices that make the package representative of the `state-of-the-art' and we highlight some internal limitations through examples of processing time discrepancies. We conclude that the development of applications like lidR are of fundamental importance for developing transparent, flexible and open ALS tools to ensure not only reproducible workflows, but also to offer researchers the creative space required for the progress and development of the discipline.},

We have extended this framework by decomposing growth rates of 130 000 trees of 171 Neotropical tree species into intrinsic growth and the response of growth to light and size. We related these growth characteristics to multiple functional traits (wood density, adult stature, seed mass, leaf traits) in a hierarchical Bayesian model that accounted for measurement error and intraspecific variability of functional traits. Wood density was the most important trait determining all three growth characteristics. Intrinsic growth rates were additionally strongly related to adult stature, while all traits contributed to light response. Our analysis yielded a predictive model that allows estimation of growth characteristics for rare species on the basis of a few easily measurable morphological traits.},

  abstract = {An understanding of the drivers of tree growth at the species level is required to predict likely changes of carbon stocks and biodiversity when environmental conditions change. Especially in species-rich tropical forests, it is largely unknown how species differ in their response of growth to resource availability and individual size. We use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to quantify the impact of light availability and tree diameter on growth of 274 woody species in a 50-ha long-term forest census plot in Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Light reaching each individual tree was estimated from yearly vertical censuses of canopy density. The hierarchical Bayesian approach allowed accounting for different sources of error, such as negative growth observations, and including rare species correctly weighted by their abundance. All species grew faster at higher light. Exponents of a power function relating growth to light were mostly between 0 and 1. This indicates that nearly all species exhibit a decelerating increase of growth with light. In contrast, estimated growth rates at standardized conditions (5 cm dbh, 5\% light) varied over a 9-fold range and reflect strong growth-strategy differentiation between the species. As a consequence, growth rankings of the species at low (2\%) and high light (20\%) were highly correlated. Rare species tended to grow faster and showed a greater sensitivity to light than abundant species. Overall, tree size was less important for growth than light and about half the species were predicted to grow faster in diameter when bigger or smaller, respectively. Together light availability and tree diameter only explained on average 12\% of the variation in growth rates. Thus, other factors such as soil characteristics, herbivory, or pathogens may contribute considerably to shaping tree growth in the tropics.},

Here we present a "benchmark" map of biomass carbon stocks over 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for REDD assessments at both project and national scales. We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49\%, 25\%, and 26\% of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from {\textpm}6\% to {\textpm}53\%, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national ({$>$} 1,000,000 ha) scales at ca. {\textpm}5\% and ca. {\textpm}1\%, respectively. The benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.},

  abstract = {Multiple-systems or capture--recapture estimation are common techniques for population size estimation, particularly in the quantitative study of human rights violations. These methods rely on multiple samples from the population, along with the information of which individuals appear in which samples. The goal of record linkage techniques is to identify unique individuals across samples based on the information collected on them. Linkage decisions are subject to uncertainty when such information contains errors and missingness, and when different individuals have very similar characteristics. Uncertainty in the linkage should be propagated into the stage of population size estimation. We propose an approach called linkage-averaging to propagate linkage uncertainty, as quantified by some Bayesian record linkage methodologies, into a subsequent stage of population size estimation. Linkage-averaging is a two-stage approach in which the results from the record linkage stage are fed into the population size estimation stage. We show that under some conditions the results of this approach correspond to those of a proper Bayesian joint model for both record linkage and population size estimation. The two-stage nature of linkage-averaging allows us to combine different record linkage models with different capture--recapture models, which facilitates model exploration. We present a case study from the Salvadoran civil war, where we are interested in estimating the total number of civilian killings using lists of witnesses' reports collected by different organizations. These lists contain duplicates, typographical and spelling errors, missingness, and other inaccuracies that lead to uncertainty in the linkage. We show how linkage-averaging can be used for transferring the uncertainty in the linkage of these lists into different models for population size estimation.},

  abstract = {In the coming century, forecast climate changes caused by increasing greenhouse gases may produce dramatic shifts in tree species distributions and the rates at which individual tree species sequester carbon or release carbon back to the atmosphere. The species composition and carbon storage capacity of northern Wisconsin (USA) forests are expected to change significantly as a result. Projected temperature changes are relatively large (up to a 5.8{$^\circ$}C increase in mean annual temperature) and these forests encompass a broad ecotone that may be particularly sensitive to climate change. Our objective was to estimate the combined effects of climate change, common disturbances, and species migrations on regional forests using spatially interactive simulations. Multiple scenarios were simulated for 200 years to estimate aboveground live biomass and tree species composition. We used a spatially interactive forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) that includes individual tree species, biomass accumulation and decomposition, windthrow, harvesting, and seed dispersal. We used data from two global circulation models, the Hadley Climate Centre (version 2) and the Canadian Climate Center (version 1) to generate transient growth and decomposition parameters for 23 species. The two climate change scenarios were compared with a control scenario of continuing current climate conditions. The results demonstrate how important spatially interactive processes will affect the aboveground live biomass and species composition of northern Wisconsin forests. Forest composition, including species richness, is strongly affected by harvesting, windthrow, and climate change, although five northern species (Abies balsamea, Betula papyrifera, Picea glauca, Pinus banksiana, P. resinosa) are lost in both climate scenarios regardless of disturbance scenario. Changes in aboveground live biomass over time are nonlinear and vary among ecoregions. Aboveground live biomass will be significantly reduced because of species dispersal and migration limitations. The expected shift towards southern oaks and hickory is delayed because of seed dispersal limitations.},

Such problems arise in citations, medical databases, genetics, human rights databases, and a variety of other applied settings. The target of statistical inference can be viewed as an unsupervised problem of determining the edges of a bipartite graph that links the observed records to unobserved latent entities. Bayesian approaches provide attractive benefits, naturally providing uncertainty quantification via posterior probabilities. We propose a novel record linkage approach based on empirical Bayesian principles. Specifically, the empirical Bayesian-type step consists of taking the empirical distribution function of the data as the prior for the latent entities. This approach improves on the earlier HB approach not only by avoiding the prior specification problem but also by allowing both categorical and string-valued variables. Our extension to string-valued variables also involves the proposal of a new probabilistic mechanism by which observed record values for string fields can deviate from the values of their associated latent entities. Categorical fields that deviate from their corresponding true value are simply drawn from the empirical distribution function. We apply our proposed methodology to a simulated data set of German names and an Italian household survey on income and wealth, showing our method performs favorably compared to several standard methods in the literature. We also consider the robustness of our methods to changes in the hyper-parameters.},

Point process characteristics are valuable tools for exploratory data analysis in forestry, for describing the variability of forest stands and for understanding and quantifying ecological relationships. Models of point processes are also an important basis of modern single-tree modeling, that gives simulation tools for the investigation of forest structures and for the prediction of results of forestry operations such as plantation and thinning.},

  abstract = {Historical forest management practices in the southwestern US have left forests prone to high-severity, stand-replacement fires. Reducing the cost of forest-fire management and reintroducing fire to the landscape without negative impact depends on detailed knowledge of stand composition, in particular, above-ground biomass (AGB). Lidar-based modeling techniques provide opportunities to increase ability of managers to monitor AGB and other forest metrics at reduced cost. We developed a regional lidar-based statistical model to estimate AGB for Ponderosa pine and mixed conifer forest systems of the southwestern USA, using previously collected field data. Model selection was performed using Bayesian model averaging (BMA) to reduce researcher bias, fully explore the model space, and avoid overfitting. The selected model includes measures of canopy height, canopy density, and height distribution. The model selected with BMA explains 71\% of the variability in field-estimates of AGB, and the RMSE of the two independent validation data sets are 23.25 and 32.82 Mg/ha. The regional model is structured in accordance with previously described local models, and performs equivalently to these smaller scale models. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of lidar for developing cost-effective, robust regional AGB models for monitoring and planning adaptively at the landscape scale.},

As opposed to popular algorithms such as agglomerative hierarchical clustering or k-means which return a single clustering solution, Bayesian nonparametric models provide a posterior over the entire space of partitions, allowing one to assess statistical properties, such as uncertainty on the number of clusters. However, an important problem is how to summarize the posterior; the huge dimension of partition space and difficulties in visualizing it add to this problem. In a Bayesian analysis, the posterior of a real-valued parameter of interest is often summarized by reporting a point estimate such as the posterior mean along with 95\% credible intervals to characterize uncertainty. In this paper, we extend these ideas to develop appropriate point estimates and credible sets to summarize the posterior of the clustering structure based on decision and information theoretic techniques.},

While dozens of crown detection algorithms have been proposed, their performance is typically not compared based on standard data or evaluation metrics. There is a need for a benchmark dataset to minimize differences in reported results as well as support evaluation of algorithms across a broad range of forest types. Combining RGB, LiDAR and hyperspectral sensor data from the USA National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform with multiple types of evaluation data, we created a benchmark dataset to assess crown detection and delineation methods for canopy trees covering dominant forest types in the United States. This benchmark dataset includes an R package to standardize evaluation metrics and simplify comparisons between methods. The benchmark dataset contains over 6,000 image-annotated crowns, 400 field-annotated crowns, and 3,000 canopy stem points from a wide range of forest types. In addition, we include over 10,000 training crowns for optional use. We discuss the different evaluation data sources and assess the accuracy of the image-annotated crowns by comparing annotations among multiple annotators as well as overlapping field-annotated crowns. We provide an example submission and score for an open-source algorithm that can serve as a baseline for future methods.},

Sample data came from the lands of the industry members of the Northern California Forest Yield Cooperative, and the coefficients were developed for use in CACTOS, the California Conifer Timber Output Simulator. The basic field data required for predictions are 50-year (at breast height) site indexes for each species in the stand as well as the following items for each tree: species, diameter at breast height, total height, height to the crown base, and number of trees per acre. The models express growth as a product of potential and competition components. For height growth the potential is based upon 50-year (breast height) site index curves while for diameter growth, potential coefficients come from an iterative procedure using ``free to grow'' trees as a starting point. The competition components rely primarily upon the relative position of the crown, expressed as the crown closure at 66 percent of the tree's height. Data from stem analysis were used to fit the height growth coefficients, but both the stem analysis and increment core data were used to fit and test the diameter growth coefficients.},

  abstract = {In forest growing at any one site, the growth rate of an individual tree is determined principally by its size, which reflects its metabolic capacity, and by competition from neighboring trees. Competitive effects of a tree may be proportional to its size; such competition is termed `symmetric' and generally involves competition below ground for nutrients and water from the soil. Competition may also be `asymmetric', where its effects are disproportionate to the size of the tree; this generally involves competition above ground for sunlight, when larger trees shade smaller, but the reverse cannot occur. This work examines three model systems often seen as exemplars relating individual tree growth rates to tree size and both competitive processes. Data of tree stem basal area growth rates in plots of even-aged, monoculture forest of blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis Smith) growing in sub-tropical eastern Australia were used to test these systems. It was found that none could distinguish between size and competitive effects at any time in any one stand and, thus, allow quantification of the contribution of each to explaining tree growth rates. They were prevented from doing so both by collinearity between the terms used to describe each of the effects and technical problems involved in the use of nonlinear least-squares regression to fit the models to any one data set. It is concluded that quite new approaches need to be devised if the effects on tree growth of tree size and competitive processes are to be quantified and modelled successfully.},

In this review, we first present an overview of traditional statistical and machine learning perspectives for modeling spatial and spatiotemporal data, and then focus on a variety of hybrid models that have recently been developed for latent process, data, and parameter specifications. These hybrid models integrate statistical modeling ideas with deep neural network models in order to take advantage of the strengths of each modeling paradigm. We conclude by giving an overview of computational technologies that have proven useful for these hybrid models, and with a brief discussion on future research directions.},

This study thus developed the tree mortality models for Prince Rupprecht larch (Larix gmelinii subsp. principis-rupprechtii), one of the most important tree species in northern China, by taking those effects into account. In addition to these factors, our models include both the tree\&mdash;and stand\&mdash;level variables, the information of which was collated from the temporary sample plots laid out across the larch forests. We applied the Bayesian modeling, which is the novel approach to build the multi-level tree mortality models. We compared the performance of the models constructed through the combination of selected predictor variables and explored their corresponding effects on the individual tree mortality. The models precisely predicted mortality at the three ecological scales (individual, stand, and region). The model at the levels of both the sample plot and stand with different site condition (block) outperformed the other model forms (model at block level alone and fixed effects model), describing significantly larger mortality variations, and accounted for multiple sources of the unobserved heterogeneities. Results showed that the sum of the squared diameter was larger than the estimated diameter, and the mean annual precipitation significantly positively correlated with tree mortality, while the ratio of the diameter to the average of the squared diameter, the stand arithmetic mean diameter, and the mean of the difference of temperature was significantly negatively correlated. Our results will have significant implications in identifying various factors, including climate, that could have large influence on tree mortality and precisely predict tree mortality at different scales.},

Motivated by aerial forest inventories and forest dynamics in general, we propose a sequential spatial approach for modeling forest data. Such an approach is better justified than a static point process model in describing the long-term dependence among the spatial location of trees in a forest and the locations of detected trees in aerial forest inventories. Tree size can be used as a surrogate for the unknown tree age when determining the order in which trees have emerged or are observed on an aerial image. Sequential spatial point processes differ from spatial point processes in that the realizations are ordered sequences of spatial locations, thus allowing us to approximate the spatial dynamics of the phenomena under study. This feature is useful in interpreting the long-term dependence and spatial history of the locations of trees. For the application, we use a forest data set collected from the Kiihtelysvaara forest region in Eastern Finland.},

A useful approach for modeling such data is via a marked point process, where the marks (i.e., measurements) and points (i.e., locations) are often assumed to be independent. Although this is a convenient assumption, it may not hold in practice. Schlather et al. (Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Services B, 66, 79--93, 2004) proposed a simulation-based approach to test this assumption. This paper presents a new method for testing the assumption of independence between the marks and the points. Instead of considering a simulation approach, we derive analytical results that allow the test to be implemented via a conventional {$\chi$}2 statistic. We illustrate the use of our approach by applying it to an example involving desert plant data.},

  abstract = {This study used high-density multitemporal laser scanner datasets acquired at different dates between 1998 and 2003 to estimate the tree mean height and volume growth at plot level in a boreal forest. Thirty-three sample plots were established in a mixed, multiple-storey forest in Kalkkinen, 130~km north of Helsinki, Finland. Plotwise attributes, such as mean height, basal area and volume, were estimated from field measurements. Laser datasets were collected with a TopoSys laser scanner in 1998, 2000 and 2003 with a nominal point density on the target of 10~points/m2. Three techniques were used to derive predictors for growth estimation: a method based on individual tree top differencing, digital surface model (DSM) differencing and canopy height distribution differencing. The regression models were developed for mean height growth and volume growth using the single best predictor derived from each method and selected predictors from all methods. Best-subset technique was used for predictor selection. The best results were obtained for mean height growth (adjusted R 2 value of 0.86 and standard deviation of residuals of 0.15~m) using the individual tree top differencing method. The corresponding values for volume growth were 0.58 and 8.39~m3~ha-1 (35.7\%) respectively, using DSM differencing. Combined use of the three techniques yielded a better result for volume growth (adjusted R 2~=~0.75) but did not improve the estimation for mean height growth. The results indicated that it is possible to determine forest mean height and volume growth with an acceptable accuracy using multitemporal laser scanning. This information could be used in growth model development and in determination of forest growth using strip-based sampling as part of large-area forest inventories, such as the national forest inventory.},

  abstract = {In forests, tree mortality strongly determines forest dynamics, creates gaps for recruitment and contributes to the coexistence of tree species. Individual-based models (IBMs) of tree mortality are key submodels in forest gap models and have been shown to drive simulated long-term forest dynamics. However, tree mortality IBMs remain poorly evaluated at the stand scale, particularly quantitatively, due to the lack of adequate tree mortality demographic data. Tree mortality dynamic data have often been absent from previous mortality IBMs, resulting in difficulty during model evaluation at the stand scale. The goals of this study were (1) to develop a spatially-explicit tree mortality IBM derived from the FORSKA forest gap model and (2) to evaluate its performance by both qualitative and quantitative fits based on a 10-year interval of tree mortality demographic data under a 9-ha forest dynamics plot (FDP) in an old-growth temperate forest in Northeast China. The results showed that, for model qualitative evaluation, the observed dead trees were mainly distributed in the southwest and northeast parts, but the predicted dead trees were centrally clustered only in the southwest part of the FDP. For model quantitative evaluation, the overall model error (Error (\%)) for all trees was -10.5\%. However, the absolute values of model error for some species (i.e., Acer spp., Betula spp., Tilia spp., Fraxinus mandschurica, and Ulmus spp.) and some diameter at breast height (DBH) classes (i.e., 30--40, 40--50, 50--60, 60--70, and {$\geq$}70\,cm) were greater than or equal to 20\%. Our study highlights that the tree mortality IBM at the stand scale still requires further improvement to enhance the model performance and that the FDPs could provide crucial data support for initialization, parameterization and evaluation in the tree mortality IBM at the stand scale in forest dynamic modeling.},
